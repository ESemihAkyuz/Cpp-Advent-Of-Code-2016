This repo shows my solutions to Advent of Code 2016.    https://adventofcode.com/2016
Puzzle inputs were excluded as detailed in the rules/requests section of AOC.    https://adventofcode.com/2016/about

I'm very new to C++ and began learning about 2 weeks prior to this repos creation.
AOC caught my attention about a week in, as I enjoy goal-based learning.
I've been spending my free time from coursework on further learning the language.
I began with 2016 as I currently intend to go through as many years as possible.

Thanks for the visit!
